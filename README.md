# Inference-Engine
The application is developed in Java. It's an inference engine that has a fact base and a rule base and will try to get to a goal by going through the rules anf filling the base of facts until we get to our goal. The features implemented:

- Forward Chaining

- Backward Chaining

- Mixed Chaining (one iteration of forward and one of backward)

- Search by goal or fill the fact base.
